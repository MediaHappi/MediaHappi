Setup overview:

Step 1: 
Unzip and upload only the contents of openaidavinci-01.zip to the root directory of your hosting server. Ex: /var/www/html/ or /home/username/public_html or whatever is the root folder of your domain/subdomain. Which will make it reachable as follows: http://yourwebsitename/
Step 2a: 
Warning! Some hosting platform hide files starting with '.' (hidden files), so make sure that in your settings of your cPanel you enable this option.
Step 2b: 
Warning! If your local Windows/Linux/MaxOS environment does not show hidden files, and you are planning to upload the script via FTP, make sure you enable viewing hidden files locally first even before unzipping, otherwise you will not upload all hidden files such as .env/.htaccess to your FTS server simply because your local environment will not see them.
Step 3: 
Everything inside of the public folder is accessible by anyone, so make sure you don't put anything sensitive there.
Step 4: 
After uploading all files and making sure that domain name has proper path set, create Mysql database and proper user in case if you don't already have one, to access this database. You can either create manually via your phpMyAdmin panel or use phpMyAdmin Wizard in your cPanel to create one.
Step 5: 
Now you are ready to run the install script. Type in your browser https://yourwebsitename/install and press Enter.
Step 6: 
This will start the installation process, click Start Intallation button.
Step 7: 
Make sure required php packages are installed and enabled on your server. Click Next to continue.
Step 8:
Make sure listed folders are publicly accessible. Click Next to continue.
Step 9: 
For database configuration, enter your newly created database credentials. Server address: localhost and Port: 3306

f all required php libraries are turned on in your hosting, installation will finish quickly and you are now fully ready to start. The default login name is: admin@example.com and default password is: admin12345. You can change it after loggin in in your profile settings.
Step 12: 
The next step is to include your OpenAI API key in Davinci Configuration page under Admin Panel.
Step 13: 
Next, go to vendor/ffmpeg folder in the root directory of the script.
Step 14:
